This project shows how to build an accurate and easy-to-understand machine learning model using Gradient Boosting.

The main goal is to follow best practices for:

Handling categorical data (like labels or text),

Training a strong ensemble model,

Understanding how the model makes decisions.

The project starts by cleaning and preparing the data. Label Encoding is used to turn non-numerical values into numbers, so the model can work with them. Then, a Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained to make predictions based on the data.
