# Loan Approval Prediction

This project presents a **machine learning model** that automates the loan approval process by assessing applicant eligibility based on financial and personal data.  

## Features
- Developed a **machine learning model** to predict loan approval outcomes.  
- Achieved **92% accuracy** using the **Gradient Boosting Classifier**.  
- Applied **label encoding** to effectively handle categorical variables.  
- Built a **Streamlit web app** for real-time loan approval predictions with a simple user-friendly interface.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Streamlit**  

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and transformed applicant financial and personal data.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Applied label encoding for categorical features.  
3. **Model Training** – Used **Gradient Boosting Classifier**, achieving 92% accuracy.  
4. **Deployment** – Developed a **Streamlit-based web interface** for end-user interaction.
